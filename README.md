**Overview**

This project is a real-world implementation of dbt (Data Build Tool) for transforming Airbnb data. It covers the entire lifecycle of dbt development, from setting up the environment to advanced dbt features. The objective is to create a structured, scalable, and efficient data transformation pipeline using dbt, Snowflake, and SQL, following industry best practices.

**Project Setup**

**Development Environment**


- IDE Setup: Installed and configured the dbt extension
- Virtual Environments: Created and activated virtual environments for package management and used VScode for coding
- Snowflake Setup: Configured Snowflake as the data warehouse for storing transformed datasets

**Key dbt Features Implemented**
This project covers a wide range of dbt features, ensuring a well-structured data transformation pipeline:

- dbt Models: Defined and created transformation models for Airbnb data
- dbt Materializations: Implemented incremental, ephemeral, and table materializations
- dbt Tests: Created custom and generic tests to validate data integrity
- dbt Documentation: Auto-generated documentation for better project visibility
- dbt Sources, Seeds, Snapshots: Implemented data source tracking, seed files, and historical snapshots
- dbt Hooks and Operations: Used pre- and post-hooks to enhance workflow automation
- Jinja and Macros: Utilized dbt macros and Jinja templating for reusable logic
- dbt Analyses & Exposures: Created additional analyses and data exposure tracking

**Data Visualization: Integrated Preset for visualization of transformed data**

**Project Execution**

The project follows a structured workflow:

- Extract & Load: Data is ingested from Airbnbâ€™s source systems into Snowflake
- Transform with dbt:
      -Cleaning, filtering, and aggregating Airbnb datasets
      -Implementing business logic transformations
      -Ensuring data consistency and integrity
- Testing & Documentation:
      -Running automated dbt tests to validate transformations
      -Generating dbt documentation for project transparency
- Deploy & Monitor:
      -Leveraging dbt Cloud for deployment
      -Setting up scheduled runs and monitoring failures



**Project Learnings & Outcome**
- By completing this project, I gained hands-on experience in dbt while mastering:
- SQL transformation logic within dbt
- Managing data models efficiently
- Implementing automated data quality checks
- Using dbt macros and Jinja for scalable transformations
- Deploying, monitoring, and optimizing dbt pipelines
